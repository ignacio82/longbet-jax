"""Opt-in CHANGE move for tree decision rules.

``bartz`` proposes only GROW and PRUNE moves. Moving a decision rule from one
cutpoint to a neighbouring one therefore requires pruning the node and growing
it again, passing through a tree whose likelihood can be far lower. On strongly
identified threshold surfaces the chains freeze at whichever cutpoints they
found first, each chain at a different one. The CHANGE move proposes a fresh
rule at a random parent of two leaves, keeps the tree shape, and accepts with
the exact marginal-likelihood ratio of the two new leaves against the two old
ones. It is applied to every tree of a forest, one tree at a time, with the
residual updated exactly between trees, after the ordinary GROW/PRUNE step.

Validity. The new rule is drawn from the same ancestor-restricted rule prior
``bartz`` uses for GROW (uniform, or ``log_s``-weighted, over admissible
variables and uniform over the admissible cutpoints), so the proposal density
cancels the rule prior. The node stays nonterminal, so its terminality factor
cancels. The children's terminal-probability factors change only through their
rule admissibility, which is included. A count threshold vetoes the move
symmetrically: the reverse move starts from the current state, which satisfies
the threshold. The leaves of an accepted move are drawn from their exact
Gaussian conditionals, and the residual is updated with the stored (rounded)
leaf values, as in ``bartz``. Univariate outcomes only, which is all LongBet
uses; per-datapoint precision scales are supported.
