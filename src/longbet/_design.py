"""The unified design matrix, and the spec that lets ``predict`` rebuild it.

Both forests split on **one** binned predictor matrix; which columns each may
use is controlled by its own ``max_split`` vector, with a zero entry blocking a
column.  That is how ``nu`` is denied the propensity score, how ``mu`` is denied
the exposure index, and how ``split_time_trt=False`` is implemented -- without a
second copy of a matrix that dominates device memory.

The layout is recorded as an ordered list of :class:`Block`s, persisted with the
model, and replayed by ``predict``.  Rebuilding from the same spec is what makes
it structurally impossible for a column present at fit time to go missing at
predict time: :func:`Design.build` fails loudly if a block's input is absent,
instead of silently producing a narrower matrix whose column indices no longer
line up with the fitted trees.
