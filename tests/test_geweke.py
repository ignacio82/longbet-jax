"""Geweke joint-distribution ("getting it right") test of the Gibbs sweep.

This checks the full transition against known prior marginals. Analytical
conditional/posterior-moment tests provide independent checks: good treatment
effect means alone can conceal incorrect conditional variances.

Method.  The successive-conditional simulator alternates

    1. draw data given the current parameters, and
    2. run one Gibbs sweep,

whose stationary distribution is the model's joint prior.  The marginal of any
parameter block under that joint is simply its own prior, which for
``sigma^2``, ``sigma_gamma^2``, ``gamma`` and ``beta`` is available in closed
form.  So the simulated marginals are compared against those analytic priors,
not against loose interval bounds.

Two different criteria are used, deliberately:

* For the **correct** sampler, deviations are measured in Monte Carlo standard
  errors computed from the *effective* sample size, since successive-conditional
  draws are autocorrelated.
* For a **broken** sampler that criterion is the wrong one -- a badly mixing
  chain has a tiny effective sample size, which inflates its own standard error
  and hides the bias.  The sensitivity test below therefore compares the point
  estimate against the correct sampler's, which is the comparison a human would
  make.
